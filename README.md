A data collection of every flavor

> "You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor - you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once."
> Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.
> "Bleaaargh - see? Sprouts.”
> ― J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

The list of specific flavors in the the canon of Harry Potter is small, but the implications are that the vast majority are left to the imagination of the reader. This project is about creating a simulation of what each flavor might be.

Have ideas for more flavors? [Create an issue](https://github.com/chrisbroski/bertie-botts/issues) with any suggestions.
